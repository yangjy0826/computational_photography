% function [cams, cam_centers] = reconstruct_stereo_cameras(E, K1, K2, data); 
%
% Method:   Calculate the first and second camera matrix. 
%           The second camera matrix is unique up to scale. 
%           The essential matrix and 
%           the internal camera matrices are known. Furthermore one 
%           point is needed in order solve the ambiguity in the 
%           second camera matrix.
%
%           Requires that the number of cameras is C=2.
%
% Input:    E is a 3x3 essential matrix with the singular values (a,a,0).
%
%           K is a 3x3xC array storing the internal calibration matrix for
%           each camera.
%
%           points2d is a 3xC matrix, storing an image point for each camera.
%
% Output:   cams is a 3x4x2 array, where cams(:,:,1) is the first and 
%           cams(:,:,2) is the second camera matrix.
%
%           cam_centers is a 4x2 array, where (:,1) is the first and (:,2) 
%           the second camera center.
